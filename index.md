I'm glad you are here. I look forward to discussing about the cloud and everything about networks.

🖐️You would want to read a summary about me before going further through my profile.

I am an aspiring Network/Communication Engineer at the Federal University of Technology Owerri with a strong quest for learning, growth, and taking on opportunities. Through hard work, creativity, and dedication, I have been awarded several scholarships🏆 both locally and on a global scale. 

🏅I strongly believe that ordinary people can become extraordinary through hard work, persistence, and commitment.

🥽Technology for educators is something I am very passionate about. I am interested in leveraging Extended Reality (Virtual/Augmented Reality), as well as my knowledge in the communication engineering industry, to change the education ecosystem in Nigeria and Africa.

Alongside my undergraduate studies, I decided to develop myself by volunteering and participating in extracurricular activities.

🌍Since May 2019, I have been volunteering for Enactus, an organization that provides students with a platform to connect with business leaders, academic professionals, and industry experts in a collaborative endeavor to solve socio-economic problems affecting communities through the creation of sustainable projects. 

🌏I have been actively involved in IEEE since April 2020 - A global organization whose purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. In 2022, I was awarded the Richard E. Merwin Scholarship🏅 by the IEEE Computer Society in a bid to acknowledge my volunteering and academic activities.

🌍I served as the Hult Prize director of campus programs at the Federal University of Technology Owerri in July 2020 - A global organization committed to raising students that envision themselves as change agents in the world by building sustainable social businesses and solving pressing societal problems. By organizing closed mentoring sessions, brainstorming sessions, and training sessions at my university, I nurtured the growth of over 100 students towards making sustainable change. 

🧠In an effort to grow and develop, I have participated in University/Department projects, internships, fieldwork, and excursions.

I have strong interests in network engineering, cloud, and extended reality. 

I look forward to mutually beneficial collaborations, internship opportunities and connections🤝. 

Fun fact: I love socks🧦🧦.
